# Alfresco Digital Workspace (ADW) Helm Chart

Alfresco Digital Workspace (ADW) is an application built using Alfresco Application Development Framework (ADF) components and was generated with Angular CLI.

To use, add the `incubator` to your local Helm.

```sh
helm repo add alfresco-incubator http://kubernetes-charts.alfresco.com/incubator
```

> **Note**: You will be able to deploy this chart on its own only if ADW is accessible from the same origin

## Versioning

The versioning of the Helm Chart is based on [SemVer](https://semver.org/) as it is [supported by Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/#charts-and-versioning).

Stable charts are published in [stable repository](http://kubernetes-charts.alfresco.com/stable).

## To install the ADW cluster

```sh
helm install alfresco-incubator/alfresco-digital-workspace
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an ADW deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster
using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-adw`:

The command deploys ACS Cluster on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.
